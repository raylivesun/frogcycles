                    <h2>Transitions and Transformations</h2>
                    <p>Work with retrospective methods is often
concerned with gaining perspective on a
culture or tradition on the far side of a cultural
change that is remote from the present, such as
Christianization of modernization. Now, we
find ourselves in the midst of such a change
and, alongside well-worn terms like pre-
Christian and pre-modern, we begin to use
pre-pandemic to describe an era before
mandatory face masks and zoom-fatigue. The
world is transforming around us, inviting us to
reflect on how the changes we study may have
been perceived in their time.</p>
                    <p>                    
A curious thing about this transition has been
its limbo-like temporality. Things that happened
pre-pandemic can easily seem a lifetime away,
while those that should occur since the pandemic
began often seem beset by Kafkaesque cancella-
tions and postponements. In many cases, these
events have felt perpetually impending yet never
occur, as though they are trapped in Zeno’s
paradox of the arrow, doomed always to cover
only half of the remaining distance to its target,
as time is subdivided infinitely. We have
wrested this journal from pandemic suspension,
so that it may reach you at last.</p>

Although time may seem limbo-like, the
contributions gathered here show that work has
not stopped and is as vibrant and diverse as
ever. Among the projects and networks that
fall under the aegis of the RMN, the Austmarr
Network has been especially active. Rather than
being postponed, Austmar X was split: Austmar
X.1 was held virtually in 2020, keeping the
annual rhythm, and Austmarr X.2 followed in
2021 (see Willson, this volume). The edited
volume based on Austmarr VII, Crossing</p>

                <td with="50%">
                    <p>Disciplinary Boundaries in Studies of the
Viking Age, edited by Daniel Sävborg, should
appear with Brepols in 2022, and a volume
surrounding Austmarr X.1–2 is being organized
by Sabine Walther.</p>
                    <p>
The Aarhus Mythology Conference has also
been lively. It is no longer ‘so-called’: informal
reference to it through its place of origin is now
treated as its name, retroactively numbering
the meetings. A publication from the 13th
event, Folklore and Old Norse Mythology, has
just appeared (Frog & Ahola, in this volume).
The publication from the 14th, The Feminine in
Old Norse Mythology and Folklore, edited by
Tommy Kuusela, will hopfully appear in late
2022 or early 2023. The 15th (see Kaikkonen &
Kozák, this volume) also has a publication in
process: Methodology in Old Norse Mythology,
edited by Jesse Barber, Amy Jefford Franks,
Jonas Koesling, Giulia Mancini and Bob van
Strijen with Frog and Simon Nygaard. The 16th
conference was just held – with much live
participation – in Reykjavík in November 2021.</p>

Transitions and transformations are also
coming to RMN Newsletter. We are returning
to an exclusively digital publication. We have
adjusted our format from continuous text to
beginning each contribution on a new page
with the journal’s full header. We are also in
the process of reorganizing our editorial
structure and invite you to see the call for
editors at the end of this issue. Our journal has
always aimed to meet the interests and needs of
you, our readership, and we hope these current
changes will help us keep pace with the future.</p>
